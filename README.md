# ImageAugmentation

## Project description
This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator to apply various image augmentation techniques to a dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for demonstration purposes, and five random images are selected to show their original and augmented versions.It also focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
