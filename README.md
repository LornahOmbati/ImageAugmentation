# ImageAugmentation

## Project description
This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator to apply various image augmentation techniques to a dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for demonstration purposes, and five random images are selected to show their original and augmented versions.It also focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Installation
1.⁠ ⁠Clone the Git hub repository or download the zip file.
https://github.com/Rethes/ImageAugmentation.git

## Image Augmentation Techniques Used
The following augmentation techniques are applied:
1. Rotation: Rotates images up to 40 degrees
2. Width Shift: Shifts the image horizontally by up to 20%
3. Height Shift: Shifts the image vertically by up to 20%
4. Zoom: Random zoom by up to 20%
5. Horizontal Flip: Flips the image horizontally
6. Rescaling: Normalizes pixel values to the range [0,1]

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The training dataset is split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for validation. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 64
